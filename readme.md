github just fucked up the readme file. read in raw option.

compile with g++ with following condition:

	g++ IC.cpp -o IC

(Or other codition you like.)
input should be formatted as followed:

no. of vertice(n)
no. of edges(m)
each vertex weight>
<each edges>(from first to second.)

for example:

6
7
1 3 17 5 2 8
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 0
4 1

There are more examples in the folder. Most of them come from the essay.
